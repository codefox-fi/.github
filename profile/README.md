## Efficient technology leadership, when you need it the most
Codefox offers fractional techology leadership services for companies, who don't have the need or the means to hire a full-time CTO.

We also offer consulting for cloud development, monolith-to-cloud migrations and integrations/APIs.

Happy past customers include Kempower and Flashnode.
